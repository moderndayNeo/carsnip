## Some Snippets From The Code

### Modern Javascript and React Practices
Asynchronous Javascript results in a smooth user experience even if an API call fails.

```js


```
### Clean CSS
Each sub-component has it's own CSS file. Use of CSS Variables results in scalability
```css

```

### Separation of concerns
Each function serves a single purpose
```js

```

### Componentization
Componentizing the app and using React Hooks allows for easily maintainable code

```js

```
